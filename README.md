Implementation of Wythoff's game

Wythoff's game is a two-player mathematical game of strategy, played with two piles of counters. Players take turns removing counters from one or both piles; when removing stones from both piles, the numbers of counters removed from each pile must be equal. The game ends when one person removes the last counter or counters.
